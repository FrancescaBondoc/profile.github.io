      <h1>Importance of Emergency Hotlines</h1>

      <p>Emergency hotlines are your instant go-to when the need arises. That’s why it is important that you keep a copy of each of the important ones with you.
        Here are all the reasons why you should be keeping an emergency hotline with you at all times.
        <br>
        <h3>Climate change is real.</h3>
        The effects  of climate change have become very evident on Earth’s state. And it’s not of the good kind. The fast-rising shift of climate has had a negative impact on the inhabitants of this planet. Forest fires and drought spell disaster for any unprepared human being. You can call for help as soon as you sense something is going on if you have the emergency hotlines with you.  You can even save the lives of those involved, even yourself.
        <br>
        <h3>Unexpected lifestyle diseases grow at a fast rate.</h3>
        More and more people die of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, rheumatic heart disease and stroke due to the type of lifestyle that they maintain. That is one thing. What causes more concern is that most people don’t even know that they are at risk of having or that they have already acquired cardiovascular diseases. Strokes and other cardiovascular diseases can be triggered anytime, and the difference between saving a life and losing it matters on how long it takes to get the help. If you have an emergency number with you all the time, you can spare one’s life.
        <br>
        <h3>Accidents to human error and negligence are now becoming a huge thing.</h3>
        A whopping number of 96,615 traffic accidents in the National Capital Region were recorded in 2015 according to MMDA. Furthermore, the same report also showed that most of these accidents were caused by human error. There’s just no stopping an accident when it’s bound to happen.
        Moreover, what one can do is be prepared by keeping a number to call when a collision happens just so help can arrive in the most immediate time.
