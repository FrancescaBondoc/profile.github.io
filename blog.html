The very nature of an emergency is unpredictable and can change in scope and impact. Being prepared and planning ahead is critical to protecting lives, the environment, and property.
            According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, “an emergency plan specifies procedures for handling sudden or unexpected situations. The objective is to be prepared to:
            
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Prevent fatalities and injuries.</li>
             <li>Reduce damage to buildings, stock, and equipment.</li>
             <li> Protect the environment and the community.</li>
            <li>Accelerate the resumption of normal operations.”</li>
             <br>
            Since emergencies will occur, preplanning is essential. At the onset of an emergency, a lot of decisions need to be made in a short period of time. Time and circumstance can mean the normal chain of command is not accessible. Added to that, stress of the incident can result in poor judgement or extensive losses.</td>

          <td style=" background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.529);"> A public awareness program typically involves announcing a notice to a population, which generally is within a specified area/zone, to communicate a message from an organization. These programs can be done via mail out but are most effectively done in person. A public awareness program is necessary whether the communicated message is about an upcoming project in the area, a generic bulletin, or a specific scope of work that will impact a stakeholder. The necessity for this type of program could be driven by community courtesy, corporate due diligence, or government regulation.
            <br>
           Our consultants work on behalf of your organization to engage with key stakeholders identified in the applicable consultation to discuss their emergency management program. In addition, the consultant provides pertinent “in case of emergency” information to the stakeholder and answers any questions or concerns that they may have regarding the company’s practices.</td>

It recognizes that there is fear and concern in the community; however, it is important to understand the measures being taken by health professionals and authorities.  Our main priority is to outline health and safety measures and protocols for the company’s employees and clients; as we understand this has the potential to interfere with personal well-being and business operations. As news breaks, it is committed to updating and altering its pandemic plan due to the developing situation and concerns over COVID-19. </td>
